## Different Types of Aliases in SQL
Aliases in SQL are used to assign temporary names to columns or tables to improve readability. There are two main types:

### 1. Column Alias
Used to rename a column in the output of a query.
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name AS EmployeeName, Salary AS MonthlySalary
FROM Employees;
```

### 2. Table Alias
Used to assign a temporary name to a table, making complex queries more readable.
```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

## When to Use the `WITH` Clause
Use the `WITH` clause when:
- You need to simplify complex queries by breaking them into smaller, modular parts.
- You want to avoid redundant subqueries and improve query performance.
- You require recursion to process hierarchical or tree-structured data.
- You need to perform multiple operations on the same dataset without re-evaluating it multiple times.
- You want to improve query readability and maintainability.

## Benefits of Using `WITH` Clause
- Improves readability by breaking complex queries into modular parts.
- Avoids redundant subqueries by defining reusable CTEs.
- Supports recursion for hierarchical data processing.

## Conclusion
The `WITH` clause (CTE) is a powerful feature in SQL that enhances query structuring and execution efficiency. It is particularly useful for improving code maintainability and readability.
