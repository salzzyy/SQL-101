## Different Types of Aggregate Functions in SQL
Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include:

### 1. COUNT()
Counts the number of rows that match a specified condition.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees;
```
**Rule:** Works with all data types but does not count NULL values unless `COUNT(*)` is used.

### 2. SUM()
Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
```sql
SELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary FROM Employees;
```
**Rule:** Works only with numeric data types and ignores NULL values.

### 3. AVG()
Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
```sql
SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;
```
**Rule:** Ignores NULL values and works only with numeric columns.

### 4. MIN()
Finds the minimum value in a column.
```sql
SELECT MIN(Salary) AS LowestSalary FROM Employees;
```
**Rule:** Works with numeric, date/time, and string data types.

### 5. MAX()
Finds the maximum value in a column.
```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary FROM Employees;
```
**Rule:** Works similarly to `MIN()`, supporting numeric, date/time, and string data types.

### 6. GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions are often used with `GROUP BY` to categorize data.
```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```
**Rule:** Every column in the `SELECT` clause that is not inside an aggregate function must be in the `GROUP BY` clause.

### 7. HAVING Clause with Aggregate Functions
Used to filter results after aggregation.
```sql
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
HAVING COUNT(EmployeeID) > 10;
```
**Rule:** `HAVING` is used instead of `WHERE` when filtering based on aggregate functions.

## When to Use the `WITH` Clause
Use the `WITH` clause when:
- You need to simplify complex queries by breaking them into smaller, modular parts.
- You want to avoid redundant subqueries and improve query performance.
- You require recursion to process hierarchical or tree-structured data.
- You need to perform multiple operations on the same dataset without re-evaluating it multiple times.
- You want to improve query readability and maintainability.

## Benefits of Using `WITH` Clause
- Improves readability by breaking complex queries into modular parts.
- Avoids redundant subqueries by defining reusable CTEs.
- Supports recursion for hierarchical data processing.

## Conclusion
The `WITH` clause (CTE) is a powerful feature in SQL that enhances query structuring and execution efficiency. It is particularly useful for improving code maintainability and readability.
